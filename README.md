## Docker Image for Computer Vision Environment Setup

This repository provides the necessary files to set up a Docker image for a working computer vision environment. The following files and components are included:

1. **requirements.txt**: This file lists the required libraries for the computer vision environment. You can add or remove libraries as needed according to your preferences.
2. **docker-compose.yaml**: This file defines the resources allocated to the Docker image. You can add or delete resources as required.
3. **Dockerfile**: This file contains the main Docker image setup instructions, including the OS and Python version to be used. You can modify the Dockerfile to change the OS and Python version as needed.

To set up the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. **Check the requirements.txt file**: Review the list of required libraries and add or remove them as necessary.
2. **Check the docker-compose.yaml file**: Examine the resources allocated to the Docker image and make any necessary changes.
3. **Modify the Dockerfile**: Update the OS and Python version in the Dockerfile as desired.
4. **Build the Docker image**: Use the updated Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and docker-compose.yaml files to build the Docker image.

Please note that the specific computer vision libraries and resources may vary depending on your project requirements. Make sure to adjust the files accordingly to fit your needs.
